# Boilerplate Gatsby Markdown Blog

Greetings ðŸ‘‹. This is a boilerplate template for a Gatsby blog powered by markdown files.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` to download required packages
- Run `npm run develop` to start up the server
- Add posts to the `posts` directory
- Update page content in the `pages` directory

Happy coding!

## Configuration

To use the graphql playground:

- Create a file called `.env.development` in the project root
- Enter the following environment variable: `GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE=playground`
- Configure when this file is loaded in `package.json`. By default, the `.env.development` file is loaded when the `npm run develop` command is executed.
